I would look at recipes or see people cooking something and then try and add my own style. My mum often comes to the UK from Thailand but I'm not sure if she likes my food! She doesn't eat anything that spicy. I make food that blows your head off, so she eats the same kind of food we make for the kids!</p>","question2":"<p class=\"bold\">What do you eat when you get back home from work, you're tired and haven't got time to cook a Pad Thai?</p><p>DONG - Most of the time I can make something in 5 minutes. A Thai staple is called 'Mama Noodles'. It's basically instant noodles that we jazz up with all kinds of stuff like eggs and sausage and chilli and lime and coriander…Either that or we order a pizza!</p>","question3":"<p class=\"bold\">What does 'Feels Good to Be You' mean to you?</p><p>DONG - I'm really proud to say that I love my job. Before doing Bang Wok, I was working in a pub where the clientele was asking for Thai Green Curry with chips instead of rice. But now I can finally serve the food I want to serve. I'm doing it properly! </p>","question4":"<p class=\"bold\">Your dishes have some interesting names…where do they come from?</p><p>DONG - Here's one example. I was in Leeds last year making a slow-cooked beef curry and I didn't know how to describe it. So I went to this school next door and said, \"I'm trying to write the menu. It's 'Beef Cooked Long-Time Curry,'\" and they thought it was hilarious. They convinced me to keep the name, instead of changing it to 'slow-cooked beef' because it's much more funny.</p>","question5":"<p class=\"bold\">How does Dong embody 'Feels Good to be You'?</p><p>SARAH - All Thai people have a lot of initiative. They say everything has to have an element of 'sunuk,' which is a Thai concept about getting satisfaction and pleasure from what you do. Dong wasn't happy with his job before Bang Wok, so he had to do something in his life that had an element of fun and made him happy.</p>","quote":"\"'Sunuk' is a Thai concept about getting satisfaction and pleasure from what you do.\"","image1":"/assets/4708da2e-66f2-48e2-b813-8cb608d81d16.jpg","image2":"/assets/ded01d5c-13bb-43cc-8ed3-88866c59e246.jpg","image3":"/assets/c6ebe603-3711-4060-9979-d98b1b86b278.jpg"},{"componentName":"story-gallery","title":"Bone Daddies Ramen Bar","copy":"<p>Bone Daddies in London, England is not your typical ramen bar. That is why it is Dong's favorite spot. There is always a twist added just to spice things up! The spot has a great mixture of modern art and homely feel. It ensures a fun surrounding as you tuck into your hearty bowl of noodles.</p>","images":["/assets/31f3421f-68ee-4083-8dc5-9e1b747d6bd1.jpg","/assets/a3269aec-5260-4c67-8e54-9b8f35b84a1b.jpg","/assets/eb490203-fbd9-4875-a1c0-71ee14d4f3a8.jpg","/assets/4e1d75ea-f3fa-49f6-85fa-9005b3b2bc78.jpg","/assets/997820e4-1716-4f45-b854-671dabaaa784.jpg"]},{"componentName":"location","lat":"51.512798","long":"-0.133896","address":"31 Peter Street, London W1F 0AR, United Kingdom"},{"componentName":"polaroid","copy":"<p>Dong and his family out in London!</p>","photos":["/assets/64fb4dc9-1c1d-43ea-80b0-0d4a13c094c4.jpg","/assets/7fe921f4-dad9-4ae4-8a5c-8cb1679140a0.jpg","/assets/ce36fa57-4e83-4daa-8455-e0e18b9db1c2.jpg","/assets/5a853103-a2bd-49e9-bb38-eabad88a8dea.jpg","/assets/23612604-1230-44ae-aeff-bab7a00895a1.jpg","/assets/3e8da4a2-fa63-4797-bb69-018e92a4f8e1.jpg","/assets/2962622c-80b0-4f5a-aebd-1d023d78664a.jpg","/assets/9f9569b8-8af9-45f6-b122-87c34df71592.jpg"]},{"componentName":"checkOutMore","articles":["originals-loux-the-african-fashionista-1","originals-the-dihzahyners-painting-up-beirut","originals-raul-a-weapon-of-mass-instruction-2","refresh-with-7up-magda-sayed-urban-knitter"]}]},"success":true}
