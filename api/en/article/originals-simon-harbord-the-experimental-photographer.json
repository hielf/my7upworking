Experimenting with tying a camera to a bunch of balloons prompted his discovery of a whole new way of seeing the world, eventually leading him to join the worldwide movement of kite aerial photographers. More recently, you¡¯ll find him slowing things down over the magical wet-plate process. Follow his journey from possible-inventor-of-the- selfie-stick to creator of vintage masterpieces.",

                "question1": "<b>We know you¡¯ve been very experimental with your photography. How has your style developed over the years?</b> <br>\nSIMON - For me it¡¯s always been about seeking and overcoming challenges. Kite aerial photography is a complicated system to develop and use, but when everything comes together it all pays off... at the moment, I¡¯m working with the Victorian wet-plate process which is all about the magic of silver and light. I guess with all of my photography, it¡¯s more about an attitude than a skill. Patience. Waiting for the stars to align to get a shot just right. Sometimes recognizing that it¡¯s time to stop, take a break and come back another day!",
                "question2": "<b>How did you originally come up with the idea of kite aerial photography?</b> <br>\nSIMON - I was working offshore on an oil rig in the North Sea. We discovered that by filling bin bags with helium and binding them together we could lift a little camera up. Then I thought of attaching the camera to a kite. I even tried with a carp pole - a long rod which we use for fishing in the UK. In that way, I suppose you could say I developed the 11-meter-long ¡®selfie stick¡¯ about 9 years ago!",
                "question3": "<b>Are there any memories that stand out in your photography career?</b> <br>\nSIMON - The memorable one has to be the kite aerial shoot I did in Egypt. When I took a little kite and camera system with me on holiday. We managed to get the kite up in Karnak over a huge temple complex, but first our guide had to to bribe a guard carrying a machine gun to turn away and look in the other direction. At another temple, a guard chased us out while the kite was still in the air. That wasn¡¯t about being slow, that was about being quick!",
                "question4": "<b>What does ¡®Feels Good To Be You¡¯ mean to you?</b> <br>\nSIMON - It¡¯s all about getting involved and engrossed in the work, especially when it comes to the wet- plate process. Just as sportsmen feel in the zone, this is very much about that feeling of flow while you¡¯re working. You¡¯re in command, everything is working in the right way, the chemistry is working and everything is just so. Getting all the equipment and cameras together and working takes time and effort ¨C but there¡¯s a magic to the process when it all comes together. It¡¯s a great feeling to just be in the moment.",
                "question5": "<b>Would you define yourself as an Original?</b> <br>\nSIMON - We all like to think of ourselves as originals. When I first put my camera beneath a kite, I had no idea I was part of a great worldwide movement of kite photographers. So not an original but a pretty rare creature!",
