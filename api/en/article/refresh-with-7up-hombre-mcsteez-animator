I worked in the feature animation business for a while, drawing storyboards for animated movies. I began animating on  cels for fun and it evolved into a career!</p>",
                "question2": "<p class=\"bold\">How did you get into creating the augmented reality cartoons?</p><p>MARTY: It started from holding a piece of glass up and drawing on it with a dry erase  marker. Then I began using Tipp-ex and Sharpies and Instagramming the photos.  Eventually I tried to animate one of them  and it was really difficult - but the result was  unexpectedly awesome looking.</p>",
                "question3": "<p class=\"bold\">What, who and where do you draw your inspiration from?</p><p>MARTY: I am inspired by people who look at  life a little differently. People like Mark Gonzales,  Andy Goldsworthy, Pablo Picasso and Jim Henson. </p>",
                "question4": "<p class=\"bold\">Why did you decide to work with 7UP and how  have you found the partnership?</p><p>MARTY: 7up came to me with an open mind  and asked me to come up with a commercial.  I gave them some pretty crazy ideas and  they were totally on board! It was a fun and  relaxed creative process. Shooting the commercial  was a little different than my normal process  because of the scale, but it was a fun challenge  and I got to meet and work with some  really creative, awesome people.</p>",
                "question5": "<p class=\"bold\">What is the key to your originality?</p><p>MARTY: I've never watched Star Wars. </p>",
