                "question1": "Yinka designs and builds his off-the-wall visions using old, unwanted furniture. He merges art and design in an avant-garde way, and puts his own take on each upcycled piece by basing them on parables that he was told as a child. Yinka is now based in London, but his Nigerian roots play a big part in making him the original artist that he is today.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>How did you start out upcycling furniture? </b>\n<br>\nYINKA - Actually, during a project at uni. I was studying product design. I just fell in love with the idea of art and design being merged together. I made a weird-looking green chair that looked like an alien 每 that was my first upcycled piece. Like all art, everyone has their own way of interpreting it. People might look at a chair and think it has to be functional. Well a painting isn＊t functional! People would say you can＊t put a chair on the wall 每 or frame it 每 but you know, you can!",
                "question2": "<b>Where did you get the idea of using parables as a narrative to your work?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nYINKA - Basically, I＊ve got two brothers and a sister and whenever we were, you know, in trouble, we would get told these parables 每 they were really quite strong, like, moral guidelines. The parable that I was told a lot was \"Whatever you sow is what you shall reap\" 每 that really made me understand that anything that I do today is what will follow me, so I made sure I always did good to people around me and to myself so I would be able to benefit from it in the future!",
                "question3": "<b>Who has inspired you along the way?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nYINKA - Well I always saw my parents be just so, so proud of their culture 每 my Mum would wear the whole traditional outfit to the corner shop - she just didn＊t care you know 每 she loved it 每 and I just admired her confidence, her proudness of being Nigerian. Over the years I wanted to know how to incorporate that, so then it＊s like 每 I＊m creating something which tells you things that I＊ve seen through my eyes growing up.",
                "question4": "<b>Would you define yourself as an original? How so?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nYINKA - Yeah actually, definitely! I haven＊t really seen anyone doing anything like me. I think because my work is so heavily inspired by what I＊ve seen and how I＊ve grown up 每 no-one can tell my story better than me ＆cause I＊ve seen it, I＊ve lived through it, you know? I can＊t tell your story better than you. I think because I＊ve got a unique story and I tell it my own way, that＊s what makes me original.",
                "question5": "<b>What does 'Feels Good To Be You' mean to you?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nYINKA - You know what, I＊ll tell you one thing, when you＊re doing design projects at uni, you have to conform to a particular style 每 brief, sketch, then the design 每 that＊s not me, I like to work in the reverse. I sketch in my head, I work as I go, that＊s how it feels good to be me. True rappers don＊t plan their lyrics, they just freestyle, it comes natural, you know? I see my work like that 每 like music 每 I take a parable and freestyle as I go.",
