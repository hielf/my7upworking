                "question1": "<p class=\"bold\">What does 'Feels Good to Be You' mean to you?</p><p>LANA - You have to be comfortable in your skin, listen to yourself and not go by what other people are telling you to do. It'll feel good to be you if you're constantly working towards what it is that you feel.</p>",
                "question2": "<p class=\"bold\">Where does the name and spelling of 'Dihzahyners' come from?</p><p>LANA - After our first painting project, we just spray-painted, \"Dihzahyners were here.\" I liked the phonetic spelling because in Arabic, \"Dahana\" means paint. A lot of Lebanese people read it and see the word 'paint' and I liked that.</p>",
                "question3": "<p class=\"bold\">Do you have a favourite Dihzahyners project so far?</p><p>JUBRAN - Yeah, an old house that we saved from demolition. Some guys were going to destroy it because it was abandoned. So we got rid of all the garbage and empty bottles, cleaned it, painted a white coat on the walls, added colours and even plants. The house is still there and everyone who passes through takes photos of it. When I walk past it, I feel happy. This is what motivates me to do more. It's not religious or political, it's just optimism.</p>",
                "question4": "<p class=\"bold\">Are there any funny stories from one of your projects?</p><p>JUBRAN - There was this old lady shouting at us once when we were painting. But it was the same lady that I had seen the week before when I'd told her exactly what we were going to do. At the time, she was happy and approved it. But then she forgot! When she finally recognised me and remembered our conversation, she smiled and said, 'Keep up the good work!'</p>",
                "question5": "<p class=\"bold\">In the future, will the Dihzahyners be doing bigger projects?</p><p>JUBAN - Yes! If we have the right equipment and tools. My dream is to do an entire neighbourhood. We've done stairs, walls and a house; I want to do things like the favela paintings in Brazil.</p>",
