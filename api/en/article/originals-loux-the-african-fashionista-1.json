                "question1": "<p class=\"bold\">How would you define your style?</p><p>LOUX - In two words: sophistication punk. It's a mixture of vintage and modern. If I'm not going to the market to buy vintage clothes, I'm designing a garment with a vintage feel that's modernised to the current fashion era.</p>",
                "question2": "<p class=\"bold\">What's unique about the fashion scene in South Africa? What do you find there that you can't find anywhere else?</p><p>LOUX - The African prints. They symbolise unity and the different cultures across Africa. The style is basically the same as in the West, but the difference is what we put on. We always try to wear prints that represent our cultures.</p>",
                "question3": "<p class=\"bold\">You speak fondly about your grandfather. How did he inspire you?</p><p>LOUX - My grandfather would dress in a suit everyday. Whenever I visited him, he would always tell me that when I grow up, I should maintain the look of wearing suits, shiny suits and ties. The tradition carries on.</p>",
                "question4": "<p class=\"bold\">When you're looking for vintage clothes in the market, what is it that catches your eye?</p><p>LOUX - If you compare a pick-up truck from 1979 and a brand new truck, the new one always breaks more easily. It's the same with clothes. At those markets, I don't even look at the fabric because I know the clothes are already high quality. But I also love finding blazers, club ties and accessories like pocket squares, cufflinks and bowties.</p>",
                "question5": "<p class=\"bold\">What does 'Feels Good To Be You mean to you?</p><p>LOUX - It's the thing that separates dreamers from entrepreneurs. It means continuing to inspire others through creativity while staying positive in action and thought.</p>",
