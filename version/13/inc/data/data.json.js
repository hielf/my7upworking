If I’m not going to the market to buy vintage clothes,<br>I’m designing a garment with a vintage feel that’s modernised<br>to the current fashion era.</p>",

They symbolize<br>unity and the different cultures across<br>Africa.<br>The style is basically the same as in the<br>West, but the difference is what<br>we put on. We always try to wear prints that<br>represent our cultures.</p>",
                        "question3" : "<p class='bold'>You speak fondly about<br>your grandfather. How did he inspire you?</p><p>LOUX - My grandfather would dress in a suit<br>everyday. Whenever I visited him, he would<br>always tell me that when I grow up, I should<br>maintain the look of wearing suits, shiny<br>suits and ties. The tradition carries on.</p>",

It’s the same<br>with clothes.<br>At those markets, I don’t even look at the<br>fabric because I know the clothes are<br>already high quality. But I also love finding<br>blazers, club ties and accessories like<br>pocket squares, cufflinks and bowties.</p>",
                        "question5" : "<p class='bold'>What does ‘Feels Good To Be You'<br>mean to you?</p><p>LOUX - It’s the thing that separates<br>dreamers from entrepreneurs. It means<br>continuing to inspire others through<br>creativity while staying positive in<br>action and thought.</p>",

                        "question1" : "<p class='bold'>Was food always important in your family?</p><p>DONG - Definitely, but I actually taught myself. I would look<br>at recipes or see people cooking something and then try and add<br>my own style. My mum often comes to the UK from Thailand but<br>I’m not sure if she likes my food! She doesn’t eat anything that spicy.<br>I make food that blows your head off, so she eats the same kind of food we make for the kids!</p>",
                        "question2" : "<p class='bold'>What do you eat when you get<br>back home from work, you’re<br>tired and haven’t got time to<br>cook a Pad Thai?</p><p>DONG - Most of the time I can make<br>something in 5 minutes. A Thai staple<br>is called ‘Mama Noodles’. It’s basically<br>instant noodles that we jazz up with<br>all kinds of stuff like eggs and<br>sausage and chili and lime and<br>coriander… either that or we order<br>a pizza!</p>",
                        "question3" : "<p class='bold'>What does ‘Feels Good to Be You’<br>mean to you?</p><p>DONG - I’m really proud to say that I love<br>my job. Before doing Bang Wok, I was<br>working in a pubwhere the clientele was<br>asking for Thai Green Curry with chips<br>instead of rice. But now I can finally serve<br>the food I want to serve. I’m doing it properly!</p>",
                        "question4" : "<p class='bold'>Your dishes have some interesting<br>names…where do they come from?</p><p>DONG - Here’s one example. I was in Leeds<br>last year making a slow-cooked beef curry<br>and I didn’t know how to describe it.<br>So I went to this school next door and said,<br>\"I'm trying to write the menu.<br>It’s ‘Beef Cooked Long-Time Curry,'\"<br>and they thought it was hilarious.<br>They convinced me to keep the name,<br>instead of changing it to ‘slow-cooked beef'<br>because it’s much more funny.</p>",
                        "question5" : "<p class='bold'>How does Dong embody<br>‘Feels Good to be You’?</p><p>SARAH - All Thai people have a lot of<br>initiative. They say everything has to<br>have an element of ‘sunuk,’ which is<br>a Thai concept about getting<br>satisfaction and pleasure from what<br>you do. Dong wasn’t happy with his<br>job before Bang Wok, so he had to<br>do something in his life that had an<br>element of fun and made him happy.</p>",

Some guys were going to<br>destroy it because it was abandoned. So<br>we got rid of all the garbage and empty<br>bottles, cleaned it, painted a white coat on<br>the walls, added colours and even plants.<br>The house is still there and everyone who<br>passes through takes photos of it.<br>When I walk past it, I feel happy. This is what<br>motivates me to do more. It’s not religious<br>or political, it’s just optimism.</p>",
                        "question4" : "<p class='bold'>Are there any funny stories<br>from one of your projects?</p><p>JUBRAN - There was this old lady shouting<br>at us once when we were painting. But it<br>was the same lady that I had seen the<br>week before when I’d told her exactly<br>what we were going to do. At the time,<br>she was happy and approved it. But then<br>she forgot! When she finally recognised<br>me and remembered our conversation,<br>she smiled and said, ‘Keep up the<br>good work!’</p>",
